COFFEE SHOP CHALLENGE
Welcome to the Coffee Shop Challenge! This is a Python-based object-oriented project that models a small coffee shop. It focuses on practicing class relationships, object associations, data validation, and basic aggregation methods.

 Overview
This application simulates a real-world coffee shop. It includes three core models:

Customer: Represents a person placing coffee orders.

Coffee: Represents a type of coffee offered by the shop.

Order: Connects customers and coffees with a price, representing individual purchases.

Youâ€™ll use object-oriented programming to build and manage relationships between these classes, ensuring data integrity and reusable logic.
